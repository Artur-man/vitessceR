After configuring a Vitessce widget, you may want to obtain the static files associated and deploy the same Vitessce configuration as a static website.
This page demonstrates this process for an example dataset from [SeuratData](https://github.com/satijalab/seurat-data).

First, install the dependencies:
```r
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vitessce/vitessce-r")
devtools::install_github('satijalab/seurat-data')
```

Create the Vitessce configuration:

```r
library(vitessce)
library(SeuratData)

SeuratData::InstallData("pbmc3k")
data("pbmc3k.final")
force(pbmc3k.final)

vc <- VitessceConfig$new("My config")
dataset <- vc$add_dataset("My dataset")
dataset <- dataset$add_object(SeuratWrapper$new(pbmc3k.final))
scatterplot <- vc$add_view(dataset, Component$SCATTERPLOT, mapping = "pca")
vc$layout(scatterplot)
```

## Export files

Run the `export` function on the `VitessceConfig` instance with the `to = "files"` parameter. Specify the directory in which to store the exported files with `out_dir`.

```r
vc$export(to = "files", out_dir = "./my_vitessce_files")
```

## Serve the exported files

Now that the files have been saved to the `./my_vitessce_files` directory, they can be served by any static web server.

If you would like to serve the files locally, we recommend [http-server](https://github.com/http-party/http-server) which can be installed with NPM or Homebrew:

```sh
http-server ./my_vitessce_files/ --cors -p 3000
```

## View on vitessce.io

The returned view config dict can be converted to a URL, and if the files are served on the internet (rather than locally), this URL can be used to share the interactive visualizations with colleagues.

```r
vc_list <- vc$to_list(base_url = "http://localhost:3000")
vitessce_url <- paste0("http://vitessce.io/?url=data:,", URLencode(jsonlite::toJSON(vc_list, auto_unbox = TRUE)))
print(vitessce_url)
```

Open the printed URL in a browser to access the visualization.

## Upload exported files to S3

Rather than serving the data files locally, you may want to upload the files to a remote static file hosting service such as AWS S3, allowing the Vitessce URL to be shared with others.
Visit our [data hosting](http://beta.vitessce.io/docs/data-hosting/index.html) documentation page to learn more about configuring file hosting services for use with Vitessce.
Install the AWS S3 command-line interface by following the instructions [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html).

Confirm that the CLI has been installed:
```sh
aws --version
```

Configure the AWS CLI by using any of the configuration methods, such as the [environment variable method](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-envvars.html).

Finally, upload the files to your bucket (swap out `my_bucket` for your bucket name):

```sh
aws s3 cp --recursive ./my_vitessce_files s3://my_bucket
```

Then, re-create the Vitessce URL, specifying the S3 bucket in the `base_url` parameter (swapping out `my_bucket` for your bucket name again):

```r
vc_list <- vc$to_list(base_url = "https://my_bucket.s3.amazonaws.com")
vitessce_url <- paste0("http://vitessce.io/?url=data:,", URLencode(jsonlite::toJSON(vc_list, auto_unbox = TRUE)))
print(vitessce_url)
```
